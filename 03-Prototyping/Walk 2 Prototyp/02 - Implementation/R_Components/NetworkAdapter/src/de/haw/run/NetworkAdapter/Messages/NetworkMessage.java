/**
 * The basic network message.
 * <br/><br/>
 * All communication in the MARLA system between MARLA-Server and -Client is realized by messages inheriting from this
 * class.
 * <br/><br/>
 * If no custom message responsible for transporting an environment plugin implementation of "enviroment state" or
 * "action description" is found in the environment plugin, MARLA will use default messages. Those messages simply
 * serialize all it's contents. This implies that all classes, that are part of an environment plugin and may be
 * contained in an "environment state" and/or an "action description" message, must implement the java.io.Serializable
 * interface. This is an adequate practice for most network messages.
 * <br/><br/>
 * If you are, however, interested in <b>customizing</b> the serialization process (mostly if you expect noticeable
 * compression and thus increased network throughput from doing so), you have to do 3 things:<br/><br/>
 * 1. (optional) Provide a custom implementation for a message by deriving from NetworkMessage<br/>
 * 2. (optional, and only if 1 was done) Tag the custom message with the @CustomMessage annotation<br/>
 * 2. Implement the  interface where there is optimization potential<br/><br/>
 * 
 * Since the full object tree of the messages is serialized, you can do step 3 anywhere you want. But because the optimal
 * serialization of an object tree can become a non-trivial task, we encourage plugins to implement logic related to
 * that in a dedicated message class.
