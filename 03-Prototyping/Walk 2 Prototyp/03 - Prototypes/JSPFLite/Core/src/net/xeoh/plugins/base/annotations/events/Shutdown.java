/**
 * Methods marked with this interface will be called on the shutdown of the {@link PluginManager}. 
 * Plugins *must not* assume anything about the status of other plugins, even if they depend on them; 
 * everyone dies alone. Just free all resources you allocated yourself, and do it fast. For 
 * example, if you want a method to be called upon the Manager's shutdown, you could 
 * write:<br/><br/>
 * 
 * <code>
 * &#064;Shutdown<br/>
 * public void bye() { ... }
 * </code><br/><br/>
 * 
 *
 * Note: Methods annotated with this have to be PUBLIC, otherwise they won't be found.
