/**
 * Use this annotation to mark functions which should be called on initialization. You
 * can be sure that at this phase all required plugins (see &#064;{@link InjectPlugin}), 
 * that have not been marked as optional, are available. So, for 
 * example, if you want a method to be called when the plugin is ready, you could 
 * write:<br/><br/>
 * 
 * <code>
 * &#064;Init<br/>
 * public void startup() { ... }
 * </code><br/><br/>
 * 
 * This method usually does not have to return a value (return type <code>void</code>). 
 * It may, however, return as well a boolean. If it then returns <code>false</code>, initialization of 
 * this plugin will be canceled, no &#064;{@link net.xeoh.plugins.base.annotations.Thread} or &#064;{@link Timer} will be started, no other 
 * &#064;{@link Init} methods will be called and the plugin will not be touched any more. <br/><br/>
 * 
 * Note: Methods annotated with this have to be PUBLIC, otherwise they won't be found.
