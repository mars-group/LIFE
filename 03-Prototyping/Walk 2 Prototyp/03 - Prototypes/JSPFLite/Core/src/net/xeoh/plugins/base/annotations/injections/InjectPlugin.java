/**
 * Inject some instance implementing the given plugin interface. If the plugin is not available 
 * at spawntime (and the dependency is marked as optional), null will be inserted. If the plugin
 * was not marked as optional this plugin will not be spawned. For example,
 * to specify that the PluginManager should be injected into the plugin, you would write:<br/><br/>
 * 
 * <code>
 * &#064;InjectPlugin<br/>
 * public PluginManager pluginManager;
 * </code><br/><br/>
 * 
 * Another example. To specify that a language service for Swahili should be injected in case it 
 * is there and null in case it is not, you could write:<br/><br/>
 * 
 * <code>
 * &#064;InjectPlugin(requiredCapabilities = {"language:swahili"}, isOptional=true)<br/>
 * public LanguageService service;
 * </code><br/><br/>
 *   
 * This ensures that the returned plugin, if it is there, is of type <code>LanguageService</code> and has the 
 * capability (see {@link Capabilities}) of processing Swahili. If <code>isOptional</code> is <code>false</code> 
 * or omitted then it is even ensured that this plugin will not be spawned unless the given service is available.
 * <br/><br/>
 * 
 * Please note: The annotated variable has to be <b>public</b>!
