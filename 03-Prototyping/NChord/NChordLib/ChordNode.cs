/*
 * ChordNode.cs:
 * 
 *  Contains the ChordNode class, which is used to describe and specify local and remote Chord nodes.
 *  A ChordNode is comprised of identifying information and an ID (hash) value.  In this implementation,
 *  the identifying information is a simple hostname/port combination, but adapted implementations might
 *  modify the identifier to use a MAC address, IP address, or fully-qualified domain name plus port number
 *  for identification.
 * 
 *  The best way to compare ChordNodes is on their ID values, and, for various reasons, ChordNode should always
 *  implement IComparable in order to easily sort and manipulate ChordNode objects.
 * 
 *  Hashing may (should) be swapped out via the centralized ChordServer.GetHash method should different hashing
 *  semantics be desired.
