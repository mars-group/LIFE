/*
 * ChordInstance.cs:
 * 
 *  Constructor and lifetime service management for the ChordInstance class.
 * 
 *  In the most common case, ChordInstance is a singleton remoting instance that is both a client
 *  and server.  To prevent an idle (but quite useful) ChordInstance from being garbage collected,
 *  the InitializeLifetimeService method must be overridden to return null.
