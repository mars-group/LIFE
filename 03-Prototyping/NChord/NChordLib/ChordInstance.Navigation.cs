/*
 * ChordInstance.Navigation.cs:
 * 
 *  The two core navigation methods, FindSuccessor and FindClosestPrecedingFinger are implemented here.
 * 
 *  FindSuccessor and FindClosestPrecedingFinger are implemented based on the specifications of the Chord
 *  paper, where the node that is the proper owner (successor) for a given ID value is located.  If the node
 *  on which FindSuccessor has been invoked is not the proper predecessor for ID, the finger table is consulted in
 *  order to determine a closer node, on whom FindSuccessor is (safely) remotely invoked.
 * 
 *  FindClosestPrecedingFinger works through the finger table until the finger with the closest preceding
 *  startValue to the specified ID is found, and the cached Successor ChordNode is returned to the caller.
 * 
 *  In addition to the standard machinery for FindSuccessor, a simple hopCount has been added for tracking
 *  and verifying efficiency of the DHT.
