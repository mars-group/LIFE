/*
 * ChordInstance.Maintenance.UpdateFingerTable.cs:
 * 
 *  Maintenance task to keep the local node's finger table up to date.  There are myriad ways in which this particular
 *  task can be implemented (e.g. run frequency vs. number of fingers updated per execution); however, in practice this
 *  approach seemed to work fairly well where a single finger is updated every second - meaning roughly once per minute
 *  the whole finger table has been traversed.  This job has also been configured to update the entire finger table in
 *  a single go, and also to be extremely un-aggressive in keeping the finger table up-to-date - in all cases, lookup
 *  still worked and efficiency under churn didn't suffer too badly either.
