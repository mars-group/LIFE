/*
 * ChordFingerTable.cs:
 * 
 *  The ChordFingerTable is used as a shortcut in navigation.  It is maintained asynchronously by
 *  the UpdateFingerTable maintenance task, and is safely initialized to the seed value (generally
 *  LocalNode).
 * 
 *  The finger table as it stands currently assumes a 64-bit ID space.  If a different bit-width ID
 *  space is desired, the size of the ChordFinger table should be changed as well.
