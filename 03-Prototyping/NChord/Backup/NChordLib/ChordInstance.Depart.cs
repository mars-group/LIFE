/*
 * ChordInstance.Depart.cs:
 * 
 *  Implements the Depart() logic for a given ChordInstance.  While not always run on departure of a
 *  node from a Chord ring (often, nodes will just become unreachable without notifying anyone),
 *  depart is a courtesy to the departing node's Successor and Predecessor so they do not have to 
 *  figure out who each other are.
