/*
 * ChordInstance.Maintenance.ReJoin.cs:
 * 
 *  Ring reformation maintenance task.  This task does a simple ring consistency check by verifying
 *  that the seed node (used to join the ring in the first place) is indeed its own successor.  In
 *  cases when a ring is partitioned or otherwise very damaged, the seed node's successor will not
 *  be itself.  Re-joining the ring via that seed node (assuming the node still exists) allows the
 *  ring to repair itself automatically in a reasonably orderly fashion.
 * 
 *  This task, however, is somewhat incomplete.  First, if the seedNode has in fact disappeared, but 
 *  not on account of ring damage (the seed node may simply have dropped off the network) then the
 *  ReJoin task will not do much good.  Second, the use of a single seed node (rather than a collection
 *  of seed nodes) could possibly lead to some degree of bottlenecking in a large ring that has somehow
 *  come undone, in the case that all (or a large number) of the nodes used the same seed node.  Modifying
 *  this task to use a collection of seed nodes (or simply to cache the seed node's SuccessorCache or
 *  FingerTable) for both verification and rejoin/retry purposes could be a better approach (and there
 *  are plenty of other potential approaches out there).
 * 
 *  The ReJoin task is configured to run every 30 seconds.  This interval is somewhat arbitrary and
 *  can be tuned as needed depending on system size and churn characteristics.
 * 
 *  Purists would likely disable this maintenance task; however, experimental experience has shown the
 *  ReJoin logic to be helpful under extreme churn despite its limitations.  More work in this area is
 *  always welcome.
