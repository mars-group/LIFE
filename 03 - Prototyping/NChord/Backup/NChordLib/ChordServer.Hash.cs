/*
 * ChordServer.Hash.cs:
 * 
 *  Implements the universally-used hash algorithm for hashing keys.  In this implementation, the
 *  MD5 hash algorithm is used, where the digest is truncated to 64-bits (in order to fit the
 *  UInt64 ID size).
 * 
 *  In previous implementations, SHA-1 hashing (again, truncated) was used with success as well,
 *  despite being considered a somewhat inferior hash algorithm for use in a DHT.
