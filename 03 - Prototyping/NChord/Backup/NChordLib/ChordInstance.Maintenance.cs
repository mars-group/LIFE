/*
 * ChordInstance.Maintenance.cs:
 * 
 *  Implementation of the core maintenance facilities that are used to keep the Chord node sane
 *  and in sync with the rest of the Chord ring.  Maintenance tasks run as background worker tasks
 *  and are started on Join and stopped on Depart.
 * 
 *  There are many ways in which maintenance could be implemented.  A possible improvement to this
 *  facility would be to allow for seamless plugability.
