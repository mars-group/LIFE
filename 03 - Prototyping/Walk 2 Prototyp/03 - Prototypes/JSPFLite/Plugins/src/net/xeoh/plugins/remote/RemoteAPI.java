     * Exports a plugin over the network. The implementation decides how to do that. An 
     * export result is returned containing additional information about the import. Please 
     * keep in mind that the simpler the plugin's interface is, the more likely the export
     * will succeed (depends on the export method; Lipe can handle pretty much, XMLRPC 
     * doesn't).<br/><br/>
     * 
     * For example, if <code>plugin</code> is a local plugin and <code>remote</code> 
     * a remote plugin, you could export your local plugin like this:
     * <br/><br/>
     * 
     * <code>
     * exportPlugin(plugin);
     * </code><br/><br/>

     * local network. Again, you should keep in mind that some details might differ, depending
     * on the export method you select, so don't be surprised if a specific method call
     * fails (as a rule of thumb, the more complex a method-signature looks like, the less
     * likely it is to work with all exporters).

    /**
     * Returns a proxy for the remotely exported object. This is the complement to 
     * <code>exportPlugin()</code>. A pseudo-plugin will be return implementing all 
     * methods of the requested interface that forwards all calls to the originally
     * exported plugin. Depending on the export type a number of method 
     * signatures might not work.<br/><br/>
     * 
     * For example, if <code>url</code> is a url contianed in the {@link ExportResult}
     * object returned by <code>exportPlugin()</code> and <code>remote</code>
     * a remote plugin of the same type as the plugin (which might be of type
     * <code>ChatService</code> was exported with, you could import your distant plugin
     * like this:
     * <br/><br/>
     *
     * <code>
     * ChatService service = getRemoteProxy(uri, ChatService.class);
     * </code><br/><br/>
     *
     * For your convenince there also exist a number of special URIs, the so called
     * <i>discovery URIs</i>. They enable you to detect services on the network without
     * having any prior knowledge about its location. These are:
     *
     * <ul>
     * <li><code>discover://any</code> - discovers the next best service implementing the given interface</li>
     * <li><code>discover://nearest</code> - the nearest (in terms of network ping) instance</li>
     * <li><code>discover://youngest</code> - the most recently started instance</li>
     * <li><code>discover://oldest</code> - the instance running the longest time</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * These special URIs can dramatically change the time the method takes. For example, <code>any</code>
     * and <code>nearest</code> should generally be the fastest in case a local service (on the same
     * machine) is found, while <code>youngest</code> and <code>oldest</code> always consider all
     * available services and take longer. Also, within the first five seconds of application lifetime
     * the discovery passes can take up to five seconds, while the remaining passes or any discovery call
     * after five seconds usually take only a fraction of a second.
     *
     * @param <R>
     * @param uri The URI to discover. See {@link ExportResult} and the description above.
     * @param remote The Plugin interface to request. 
     * @return A pseudo-plugin serving as a stub to the remote object.
