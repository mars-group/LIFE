/**
 * 
 * Called when a plugin of the given interface was registered. For example, if you want to 
 * be called when a new Plugin of the type <code>StorageService</code> was added, you could 
 * write:<br/><br/>
 * 
 * <code>
 * &#064;PluginLoaded<br/>
 * public void checkPlugin(StorageService service) { ... }
 * </code><br/><br/>
 * 
 * This method is especially useful in the case of plugins added <i>in the future</i>. Sometimes
 * you rely on a plugin which is not there in the early stage of your application lifetime. If you 
 * depended on it with {@link InjectPlugin}, you either would not see it, or your own plugin would
 * be suspended until it was loaded. Using the <code>PluginLoaded</code> you can start up anyway
 * and wait for it in this callback-like mechanism.<br/><br/> 
 *    
 * Note: Methods annotated with this have to be PUBLIC, otherwise they won't be found.
