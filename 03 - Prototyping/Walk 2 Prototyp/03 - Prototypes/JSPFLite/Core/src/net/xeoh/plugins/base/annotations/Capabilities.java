/**
 * Methods marked with Capabilities are queried by PluginInformation. The method MUST be
 * public and it MUST return a String[] array. If several methods are annotated it is
 * undefined which one will be called. <br/><br/>
 * 
 * As soon as the &#064;{@link Init} annotation is processed the capabilities function must be 
 * operational. Use this function for example to tell which file extensions you can handle 
 * or the (limited number of) host you can connect to. While this method can return different 
 * values on every call it is considered "bad taste" if latter calls return anything less 
 * than the previous calls.<br/><br/>
 * 
 * For example, if you want a plugin to indicate that it can handle a set of languages,
 * you could write:<br/><br/>
 * 
 * <code>
 * &#064;Capabilities<br/>
 * public String[] capabilities() { return new String[] {"language:english", "language:german"}; }
 * </code><br/><br/>
 * 
 * Later on, you can use {@link OptionCapabilities} within the {@link PluginManager}'s <code>getPlugin()</code> method to 
 * retrieve all plugins providing certain capabilities.
