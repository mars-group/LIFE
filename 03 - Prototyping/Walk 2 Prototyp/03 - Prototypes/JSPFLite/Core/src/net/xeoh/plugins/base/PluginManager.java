/**
 * This is your entry point to and the heart of JSPF. The plugin manager keeps track of all 
 * registed plugins and gives you methods to add and query them. You cannot instantiate the
 * PluginManager directly, instead you<br/><br/>
 * 
 * <center>create this class the first time by a call to {@link PluginManagerFactory}<code>.createPluginManager()</code></center>
 * 
 * <br/><br/>
 * Afterwards you probably want to add some of your own plugins. During the lifetime of your 
 * application there should only be one PluginManager. The PluginManager does not have to be 
 * passed to the inside of your plugins, instead, they can request it by the &#064;{@link InjectPlugin}
 * annotation (i.e, create a field '<code>public PluginManager manager</code>' and add the 
 * annotation).<br/><br/>
 * 
 * There are also a number of default plugins you can retrieve right away (without calling 
 * <code>addPluginsFrom()</code> explicitly.). These are:<br/><br/>
 *  
 *  <ul>
 *  <li>{@link PluginConfiguration} - enables you to get and set config options</li>
 *  <li>{@link PluginInformation} - provides meta information about plugins</li>
 *  <li>{@link InformationBroker} - supports information exchange between plugins while keeping them decoupled</li>
 *  </ul><br/>
 *  
 * In addition (and after loading the specific plugin) you can also retrieve a RemoteAPI.   
 * <br/><br/>
 *    
 * The following configuration sub-keys are usually known for this class (see {@link PluginConfiguration}, keys must be set 
 * <em>before</em> createPluginManager() is being called, i.e., set in the {@link JSPFProperties} object!):<br/><br/>
 * 
 *  <ul>
 *  <li><b>cache.enabled</b> - Specifies if the known plugins should be cached. Specify either {true, false}.</li>
 *  <li><b>cache.mode</b> - If we should use strong caching (slow but more accurate) or weak (much faster). Specify either {stong, weak}. </li>
 *  <li><b>cache.file</b> - Cache file to use. Specify any relative or absolute file path, file will be created / overwritten.</li>
 *  <li><b>classpath.filter.default.enabled</b> - If Java default classpaths (e.g., jre/lib/*) should be filtered. Specify either {true, false}. Might not work on all platforms as expected.</li>
 *  <li><b>classpath.filter.default.pattern</b> - Specify what to filter in addition to default classpaths. Specify a list of ';' separated tokens, e.g., "jdk/lib;jre/lib". Will be matched against URL representations, so all \\ will be converted to / (and ' ' might become %20, ...).</li>
 *  <li><b>logging.level</b> - Either {OFF, FINEST, FINER, FINE, INFO, WARNING, ALL}. Specifies what to log on the console. </li>
 *  </ul><br/>

     * <li><code>addPluginsFrom(new File("plugin.jar").toURI())</code> (the given plugin directly, no scanning is being done).</li>
     * <li><code>addPluginsFrom(new URI("http://sample.com/plugin.jar"))</code> (downloads and adds the given plugin, use with caution).</li>
     * <li><code>addPluginsFrom(new ClassURI(ServiceImpl.class).toURI())</code> (adds the specific plugin implementation already present in the classpath; very uncomfortable, very fast).</li>
