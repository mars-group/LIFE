 * Think of the information broker as a large, shared and type-safe hybrid between a
 * {@link Map} and a Bus. It enables you to exchange information between a number of
 * plugins by well known
 * keys. In contrast to a Bus, the exchanged items are stored and can be retrieved
 * by their key any time. Like the bus, however, listeners can register for updates to
 * certain
 * keys to be able to react on changes to them.<br>
 * </br>
 * 
 * The new InformationBroker interface supersedes the old Bus (previously present in
 * JSPF), as it provides similar functionality.<br>
