/**
 * Main enty point to the diagnosis. Allows your application to record diagnosis data to various channels, which
 * can then be stored in a diagnosis.record for later analysis. 
 *

 * The following configuration sub-keys are usually known for this class (see {@link PluginConfiguration}, keys must be set 
 * <em>before</em> createPluginManager() is being called, i.e., set in the {@link JSPFProperties} object!):<br/><br/>
 * 
 *  <ul>
 *  <li><b>recording.enabled</b> - If we should record to a file or not. If switched off, diagnosis has virtually no overhead. Specify either {true, false}.</li>
 *  <li><b>recording.file</b> - File to which the record should be writte (will be overwritten).</li>
 *  <li><b>recording.format</b> - Format to write. Should be <code>java/serialization</code> for now.</li>
 *  <li><b>analysis.stacktraces.enabled</b> - If true, a stack trace will also be written. Very helpful, rather slow. Specify either {true, false}.</li>
 *  <li><b>analysis.stacktraces.depth</b> - Depth of the stacktrace. Specify either something from 1 to 10000.</li>
